WELCOME TO THE COORDINATING CONJUNCTION

The coordinating conjunction is like the subordinating conjunction
except it doesn't make a subordinate clause.
In other words, it doesn't open up a set of parentheses.

There are only three that we will use:
"and"
"or"
"but"

Click on a coordinating conjunction in the following sentence:


@
The cat takes a nap %and% the mice build a house.

The dog goes away %or% the rooster gets angry.

The bird is awake %but% the worms are asleep.
@

Sometimes we will get a hint that a coordinating conjunction is lurking,
because a slash will break up one sentence from another:


The chickens eat / and the cats sleep.


But you should be able to spot a coordinating conjunction even without a hint.
Remember, there's only three coordinating conjunctions: "and" "or" & "but".

Give it a try. Click on a coordinating conjunction in the following sentences:

@
The cat drinks milk %end% the mice are sleeping.

The rooster crows %but% the dog gets angry.

The bird takes the bread %or% the mice take the bread.
