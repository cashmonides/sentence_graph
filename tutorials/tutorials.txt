Here's a list of subordinating conjunctions that we will see a lot of:
if  
when
that
why
how
who
which
because
although
while


Sometimes we will get a hint because the subordinating conjunction will open up with a parenthesis ( ) :


The chickens eat (while the dogs play).


But you should be able to spot a subordinating conjunction even without a hint.

Give it a try. Click on a subordinating conjunction in the following sentences:

@
The cat drinks milk %while% the mice are sleeping.

%If% the rooster crows, the dog gets angry.

The bird doesn't know %that% all the fish have left.
@

Practice with a few more sentences. These ones all have parentheses as hints. 

Here's a list of all the subordinating conjunctions:
if  when   that    why   how    who
which   because   although    while

Click on the subordinating conjunction in the sentences below:

@
The cat drinks milk (%when% the mice are sleeping.)
(%Because% the rooster crows), the dog gets angry.

The bird doesn't know (%why% all the fish have left.)
@

Now practice on some without the parenthesis as hints.

Here's a list of all the subordinating conjunctions:
if  when   that    why   how    who
which   because   although    while

Now click on the subordinating conjunction in the sentences below:


@
The cat drinks milk %although% the mice are sleeping.
%Although% the rooster crows, the dog gets angry.

The bird doesn't know %if% all the fish have left.
@

#1
WELCOME TO THE COORDINATIN CONJUNCTION

The coordinating conjunction is like the subordinating conjunction
except it doesn't make a subordinate clause.
In other words, it doesn't open up a set of parentheses.

There are only three that we will use:
"and"
"or"
"but"

Click on a coordinating conjunction in the following sentence:


@
The cat takes a nap %and% the mice build a house.

The dog goes away %or% the rooster gets angry.

The bird is awake %but% the worms are asleep.
@



#2

Sometimes we will get a hint that a coordinating conjunction is lurking,
because a slash will break up one sentence from another:


The chickens eat / and the cats sleep.


But you should be able to spot a coordinating conjunction even without a hint.
Remember, there's only three coordinating conjunctions: "and" "or" & "but".

Give it a try. Click on a coordinating conjunction in the following sentences:

@
The cat drinks milk %end% the mice are sleeping.

The rooster crows %but% the dog gets angry.

The bird takes the bread %or% the mice take the bread.
@



#3

Practice with a few more sentences. These ones all have slash-marks as hints. 

Remember, there's only three coordinating conjunctions: "and" "or" & "but".

Click on the coordinating conjunction in the sentences below:

@
The cat drinks milk %and% the mice are sleeping.

The rooster crows %but% the dog gets angry.

The bird takes the bread %or% the mice take the bread.
