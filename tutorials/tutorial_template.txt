heading: ,

image: ,
// The text of the tutorial
body: ,
// The question asked at the end of the tutorial (page)
// (sometimes a default "none" value)
question: ,
// The list of answer choice (strings)

back_button: ,

//sometimes empty because only correct answer advances
advance_button:

main thing: we feed this into a make function

important methods and functions:
- get_tutorial_order    //by analogy with get_module_order
    - not like modules
    - rather: gets order of tutorial pages for that tutorial
- keep ALL_TUTORIALS as all-caps since it's a constant (that's a js best practice)
- decide whether we store them as strings or integers
- pages are numbered within each tutorial
- 0 page (starter page, doesn't actually have content but is a good practice)
