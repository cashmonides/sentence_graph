Silence is a true friend (who never betrays).
There was an old man (who supposed
(that the street door was partially closed));
but some very large rats ate his coat and his hats,
(while that futile old gentleman dozed).
(What we achieve inwardly) will change outer reality.
There was an old woman (who lived in a shoe).
