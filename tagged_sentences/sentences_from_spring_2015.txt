IMPORTANT BACKSTAGE STUFF
- maybe no penalty for wrong answers in purgatory
- floor at 0 in fact and display
- guided section +3, -1    
- purgatory +3, -0        
- can we test each question?


PURGATORY BEHAVIOR
- +3, -1
- random questions
- seems to be missing asterisk functionality for some unknown reason


TEMPLATE FOR MANUAL ENTRY
TYPES OF QUESTION
- single answer
- non-max
- max
- multiple parts with different non-maxes



RULES FOR MANUAL INPUT (guided non purgatory)
- try for 120
- in guided, numbered, non-purgatory
- <a1> etc.
-  acceptable genres: single answer, non-max, max, multi-part non max
- 1.1  right ->  2.1
- 1.1 wrong -> 1.2
- no long dashes



RULES FOR PURGATORY INPUT
- tag it with <purg>
- end message (for those who've reached the bottom in purgatory, i.e. the last question) : your score is still beneath 100, start from the beginning and try again!
- try to make 30 questions or more in purgatory
- no long dashes






INPUT FOR MANUAL (non-random) 
''', '''		''', '''	separation between different questions (i.e. questions about different quotations)

~				~			wraps an individual question (possible part of a sequence of questions)

@							correct answer
^							incorrect answer
#		#					wraps a correct multi-word answer (be careful to have no ^ in a # passage)

+   			+			wraps a quotation or answer choices, treating every word that is not marked as correct (i.e. no @ or #  # ) as incorrect 


*          *				wraps the linked text in a multi-part question, specifically as follows
*      %    				the question (e.g. find the X(s))
%		%					response to the correct choice (e.g. good, find another X)
%      *					response to the incorrect choice (whoops, try again)

`      `                    makes a text green but not linked (i.e. use this when the text is not surrounded by +   +)



<a1> is invisible to the program but perhaps useful for the user
BUT Dan needs to know how many questions are in each level (e.g. a : 1-9, b : 1-8, c : 1-9)
potential problems:
- will it be a problem for different levels to have different number of questions?
- will high numbers (7,8,9) be problematic? (prob. not if we floor the points at zero in both fact and display)
