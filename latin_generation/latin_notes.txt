HACKY
- in general, the dictionaries might be effectively replaced with an object
- set_kernel_properties_2 is way hacky
    - seems to handle gender (which so far isn't handled by cartesian??)
- in make_output_2 we declare the elements kind of arbitrarily, they really should just be read from states
    - we should have access to template in make_kernel_new which has
- the following seems really hacky: output['subject_in_english'] = Array.from(new Set(output.map(function (x) {return x['subject_in_english']})));
- unify make_kernel and make_kernel_new
- in pick_lexeme_new we have a bit of hackiness:
    - part of speech is as follows: var part_of_speech = (element === "verb" ? "verb" : "noun");
    - but we really want this to handle other parts of speech too
- currently pick_lexeme_new returns a random_choice of allowed_lexemes
    - but shouldn't it return the full list and we make the random choice elsewhere
    - that would be more modular
    - and we might want to use the full list of allowed lexemes elsewhere
- return 'should not be made' is kind of hacky
- language_enum is not implemented well - both inflect english and inflect latin are hard-coded whereas they should be dependent on language_enum



FIX
- set_word_setting_new seems to be totally latin based - is there some way to make it language independent?

CONSISTENCY
- make_form currently seems obsolete, should it be rescued?


ADD
- make word order part of level_to_allowed (right now it's hard coded in make_kernel_new


POSSIBLE CHANGES


BUGS
english correct answer is in the wrong order
when we have multiple other nouns we don't want them all to be the same number so we need to revisit the "number of other nouns" category
no choices in drop down
give away answer doesn't move to next question
text is clickable in latin mcmode

CHANGES BY AKIVA S
- level removed as an argument from make_kernel_template


TODO
sequence needs to be moved to level_to_allowed
word_setting_generator is currently probably obsolete and should be incorporated within another file
replace random choice with actual functions
start in sentence_tree_generator has to be replaced

//todo language_enum is not implemented well - both inflect english and inflect latin are hard-coded whereas they should be dependent on language_enum
//todo make_kernel and make_kernel_new should be unified (make_kernel used for random)
