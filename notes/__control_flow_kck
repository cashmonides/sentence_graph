at some point fairly early on the whole package meets up with the lexeme_constraints
    (this is so named I guess because it is a constraint that arises when a lexeme is picked
    e.g. if an intransitive verb lexeme is picked, it will impose certain constraints)
    
    i.e. there are certain data-centric constraints such as "intransitive verbs must be active"
    so we basically filter constraints and allowed together
    
    (add further explanation here)
