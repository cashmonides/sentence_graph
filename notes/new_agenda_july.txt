AGENDA

discuss design principles - come up with plan
- agree on coding rules (??? coding rules may already be understood)
- and steps in morphology (likely more important)

- Dan had fun writing a file that both checks other files and itself conforms to the current standards.

create basic proof of concept
- amat and portat in present, imperfect, future indicative (english, latin, sss-latin, perfect language)
- at least have some idea of what each component of the system does, and what the different types of object are

question:
Should there be a random seed controlling what sentence/kernel/verb gets made, in the interests of
being able to duplicate results?
If so, the lexicon plus this seed would always give the same sentence.

start:
lexemes (amat, portat)
middle:
gnivol erew ew (subtitute for unknown (as of July 7th) perfect language, will be filled eventually)
end:
amabamus, we were loving, gnivol erew ew (perfect language)
