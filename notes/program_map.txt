            (pushes Sentence object to firebase)
            (in this format:   data : JSON.stringify(sentence))






SOME TERMINOLOGY:
tags = 1st column
    e.g. noun, subject, object, etc.
regions = 2nd column
    e.g. cat jumps in
allregions = 3rd column
    a string that gives "cat = noun, subject"
subregions = 4th column
    originally, I think, the idea was 3rd column is cat, click on it and you get all the tags it has (noun, subject, etc.)
    but then it seemed that clicking on it was extra work, so we just put in an equals sign
    so now the 4th column is otiose
