SQL NOSQL ETC.
reevaluate our setup
english sentence tagging might live best as data (based on our experience with upper level latin students)
    - data easier to fix and proofread
    - I believe our upper level was sort of a hybrid between data and firebase, it was entered as data and converted to firebas

    - something like: produce 100 sentences and right answer at each level 
- having a switch for test/production/release/whatever

REDESIGN THE BASIC KCK
- in the light of the hacks it has encrusted upon itself
- in the light of linguistics




DEEPER SEMANTICS
- maybe at some higher level of student sophistication, remove the weakly ditransitive verbs
    - e.g. love is mostly transitive, used intransitively only in highly context-bound scenarios (e.g. odi et amo)
    - in the intro levels (vcv type sentences) we want to see love a lot, even if used intransitively and a little fishy
        - e.g. he loves because they attacked is not a great sentence but it has the virute of giving them practice in useful words 
    - so maybe we allow all ditransitive possibilities when in vcv mode but not in full sentence mode
    - are there other ditransitive verbs that are just as strong transititve and intransitive??
