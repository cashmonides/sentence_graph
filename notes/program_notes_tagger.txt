9-15 issues
- Akiva changes:
    - added clear highlights button
    - set up coordinate clause when you hit a /

- seems least cluttered to just have one tagtype for clauses
    - with a specification of whether it's main or subordinate
    - and then if it's subordinate it should have a clause type, what kind of

- coordinate clause needs to be set at the same level as its "sibling"
    - i.e. if its sibling is main, then it's main and if its sibling is subordinate, it's also subordinate

- safari runs totally differently (firefox seems ok)



9-15 needed functionality smaller
- delete a single tag (as opposed to delete all tags) (would be useful when correcting a mistake)


9-15 needed functionality bigger
- anything that isn't autotagged could be a specific color
    - i.e. you load a sentence, everything is grayed out that hasn't been autotagged
    - gives you a sense of what you need to tag by hand
- improve the autotagging - possibly via webscraping?



DOWN THE ROAD
- useful to have a button that sets the level of the sentence (i.e. if it's a hard sentence it gets a higher level)
- a box for custom questions - e.g. "Find at least 3 prepositions in the following sentence"










set not implemented in explorer and safari
so, question 1: is set doable at all?
question 2: why do a set in the first place if it has to be converted into a list?



TODO

make new clause objects when the button is clicked (main clause, subordinate clause, etc.)

coordination

keyboard tagging



TODO

make main clause processed by process bracketed text (currently it only creates subordinate clauses)




TODO

where did make clauses go - where should it go
















this.add_tag = function(tag) {
        if(tag.get_tag_type().indexOf("clause") !== -1) {
            region.make_clause(tag_type);
        }
    };




Dan's code
some returns true if some satisfy the condition









POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
make words in play a parameter not a global variable



AGENDA FOR SUNDAY





- indices issue
- add open-bracket tagger
- run some twine grammar game questions as a test
- run some latin sentences

TODO NEXT
- clause.superordinate & clause.subordinate & clause.coordinate_left & clause.coordinate_right
- adding coordinating functions
- create an ability to highlight multiple words and then click button and that gives separate regions (subject, object, noun, verb, etc)
- auto-tagging
    - expand auto-tagging dictionary
        - add more pronouns, etc.
    - link auto-tagging dictionary to a web scraper (which would auto tag nouns, verb, adjs, advs, etc.)
    - display auto-tags and confirm/disconfirm


TODO IN LATIN GENERATOR

- make a map from level to allowed parameters (language dependent)
- create a mental verb module
- make a kernel/conjunction generator
- make agreement and the verb to be
- make_conjunction




TODO with Gio
make multiple highlights not all add as a single region (e.g. dog bell father should be three separate regions)
(maybe make a separate action for multiple buttons)



TODO cleanup
make a nicer clean output with regions and clause.subject


TODO bugs
- subordinate clause is getting entered twice
- in CLEAN OUTPUT we get undefined=which my father made ) rings



TODO bigger fixes
- make process_bracketed_text only display the brackets in the box, not actually add them as words



TODO questions
- how shouls quotes be tagged
    - author, work, integer
    - author + integer (with an option for anonymous, unknown, author?)
    - integer (sounds like a bad idea)


TODO add functionality
- create a dictionary of auto-tagged words (when, the, a, under)



TODO brute force tasks
- bracket some latin sentences for tagging
- bracket some sentences from the twine grammar game
- build up a dictionary of words that can automatically tag words: the, a, under, when, although, if


TODO
- add specific clause property to AS code
- review and add dan's bracket tagger
- merge indices
- run some tests (including latin sentences)



PRIORITIZE
1) - find and fix bug and as progressing pay attention to little differences
(debug.sat

2) get specific clause property into AS

3) get open bracket tagging

4) DS look at the tagged-boxes

TODO
bugs
- subordinate clause shows up twice



TODO MERGE CODE
DS FUNCTIONALITY
- add properties such as clause.subject to a clause
- open-bracket tagging (tag an open bracket and it tags the entire clause)

AS FUNCTIONALITY
- tagged-boxes
- firebase addition


MISMATCHES
- indexing starting at 1...


LITTLE THINGS IN AS CODE
- the bug
- when AS processes bracketed text, the main clause is not tagged and producexd











TODO DILEMMA
- on the one hand:
    - we want a region to be tagged with something like "main clause, subordinate clause, etc."
        (i.e. we want this to be parallel with the tagging of nouns and subjects)

- on the other hand:
    - we want an easy way to access the different clauses in a sentence
        e.g. we want to be able to ask easily clause.subject is what?


the fork in the road:
1) - make a Clause object which is the tag of a region'
    - it's accessed via region.tags[0] or some semi-clunky way (is there a better way to access it?)
2) make a property of each region which is region.clause
    - obviously this would be irrelevant for nouns and verbs etc.
    - but it would be easy to access
