AGENDA FOR WEDNESDAY IN MAY SPELLING BEE
- test current setup in random deterministic list mode
- decide whether we want to change
- ***generate random words_only list
- ***manually prune
- ***store in firebase
- ***tweak spelling bee setup page to get word_list from firebase
- disable hint button??? for final solo spelling mode
- test with multiple computers

- daily archive of word scores







DONE
- no sequence or relative time for jussive, potential, optative, deliberative and all conditionals

- add defensible and acceptable according to the model


- implications should be added to the actual source data (i.e. the inline tagged text)

e.g. 
text 1 enters
implications happen
text 2  comes out and is stored somewhere

- alert message with all tags (button either says submit or fix)

-------------------------
