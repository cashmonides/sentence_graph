OVERALL ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROJECT
building a bulletproof curve-based modeling of the levels

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
write a small unit testing 


FUNCTIONAL BABY STEPS
go through current javascript code and rewrite messy stuff as functions in separate files
continue creating modules that are chained together
ultimately send them into unit tests

write functional vs dysfunctional comparisons of leetcode solutions and basic operations like reverse string, does_x_match_y


play clojurescript koans

FUNCTIONAL MEDIUM STEPS
play around with elm and try to create a hexagon based game with dan


FUNCTIONAL BIG STEPS
haskell
a mini haskell project doing string manipulation of latin elements (e.g. aba, abi) and etymological elements (e.g. quadr.u.ped.al = root.connector.root.for
