WEBSITE TALKS TO DATA IN 2 WAYS
- talks to sql via lib/ajax.js  ---> lib/sql.py  ---> databse
- talks to firebase with Persist library (Persist.get, Persist.set)



GOOD FIRST STEP
- bar graph with 
- x-axis = accuracy
- y-axis = number of words or roots with that accuracy
- broken down into 10% ranges
- so there are ten columns
- maybe color runs the spectrum from red to yellow to green
- hover on each bar --> list of words displayed at that level
- e.g. hover on 1-10% ---> sidebar lists all words whose accuracy is between 1 and 10%


DATA IS IN FIREBASE
- path = word_scores --> uid --> list of objects ---> properties: correct, total, item


FIREBASE FUNCTIONS

- bulk of firebase persist operations are in lib/persist
- get word_scores and get word_scores_accuract is in history/history_utils.js



CONTROL FLOW FOR WORD SCORES DATABASE QUERY
- button on profile "display word scores"
----> calls the function  ProfilePage.display_word_scores in Persist
----> calls the function history_display    in history
