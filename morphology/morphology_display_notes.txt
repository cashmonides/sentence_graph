there are a few major components of our morphology display 
    - the setting up of the morphological elements into a grid (possibly using the make function)
    - making each word clickable (possibly using the word selector)
    - the click on each word should populate a block of three cells
    - when all 3 cells are populated, the answer is submitted
    - the student's answer is compared to the correct answer and turned red/green


the word selector in quick mode
    the basic outline is this
    in next_question
        this.quiz.set_word_selector(data.sentence);
        this.quiz.word_selector.click_callback = this.quiz.process_answer.bind(this.quiz);
    in process_incorrect_answer
        this.quiz.word_selector.clear();
     
     
     in more detail:
     
     (we assign where we want the word selector to go - testbox)
     Quiz.prototype.set_word_selector does this:
        var text_data = new Text(word_sel_input);
        text_data.setup();
        this.word_selector = new WordSelector("testbox", text_data);
        this.word_selector.setup();   
     
     
     
     
     
     Quiz.prototype.set_word_selector = function(sentence){
        el("testbox").innerHTML = "";
        
        this.sentence = sentence;
        
        
        var word_sel_input = sentence.text ? sentence.text : sentence;
    
        var text_data = new Text(word_sel_input);
        text_data.setup();
        this.word_selector = new WordSelector("testbox", text_data);
        this.word_selector.setup();    
        
    };
        
        
the word selector in morphology mode    
    the click_callback will be bound to something like "submit morphological element"
        that will populate one of the 3 cells with a or aba or abi and such
        (when all 3 cells are populated the answer will be automatically submitted and compared)
  
  


setting up the word selector
    the main problem now is that all 3 new word selectors seem to behave as if they're one
    so highlighting the 2nd index in the middle block, ends up highlighting the 2nd index in the first div


binding
    we bind the clicks on each element to a submit_morphological_element function
    I'm not sure we can do something simple like submit_morphology("inout string", cell_destination).bind
        (we get errors like 
    that needs to call the word_selector method get_word 
    get_word needs the index
    we might??? be able to get this from the word selector method  get_selected_indices



perhaps easier would just be to create a bunch of buttons, each with a function




/////////THE BUTTON APPROACH////////////
we need to dynamically create buttons

so we iterate over our morphological output
and for each item we create a button
    var button = document.createElement("BUTTON");
this button is now empty of text, so we need to add the text (e.g. amav, aba, erunt)
    one method is this:
    var t = document.createTextNode("ABA");     
    button.appendChild(t); 
then we append it to the div
    document.body.appendChild(button); 

we also need to make the button send the right information to the quiz
and this involves two things: giving it an on-click function and assigning the morphplogical value to that click
    this might work
    button.onclick = function;    //not a string
    
    or maybe this:
    button.onclick = function(){ //code in here };
    
    (I think the point is the function must be assigned, not called, so it can't have arguments, it must ebe anonymous)
