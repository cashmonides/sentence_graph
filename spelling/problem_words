monocular??


polychromatic and monochromatic??

make sure hepta is on there


HERBI should probably be changed to HERB/HERBI

change definition of tricycle

multicolored should not be on the list (confusing with polychromatic)   


polyglot = monolingual


quadruped = tetrapod
quart and quad

multiple ('having many parts') is not a very good definition

osteoarthritis doesn't have a definition that can distinguish it from arthritis


carnivore and carnivorous are dangerously close


pediatrician might be entered with PED/POD foot/leg
