BASIC DESIGN
    - combo of etymology and input mode
    - for now we can probably just tie it to the etym_level 
        (not sure if it needs anything other than etym_level)

pick word
    - simple approach (pick any word that has allowed roots)
    - more complex approach (pick any word that has allowed roots that is also at the right level)
    
display question
    - e.g. spell the word that means "a four sided geometrical figure"
    - (using: etymology's word_definition to word functionality)
    
generate clue for cheat sheet
    - e.g. QUADR = four LATER = side
    
    
generate dummy words for cheat sheet
    - (just to make it harder)
    
    
get display level for question and clues
    keeping original capitalization of words
    e.g. 
        easy: a FOUR SIDEd geometrical figure, part of a machine operated by the FOOT
        advanced: all lower case
    
display clues on cheat sheet
