WRITE TO FB: INITIALIZE GAME

    - parameters input by user of head computer:
        - level
        - number of questions
        - time limit (# of seconds)
    - parameters autogenerated
        - pin
        - start time
        - stop time
    - write to firebase current_game folder
    
    
// skip for now 
INTERVENING FUNCTION
- compress question into a more easily managed object to write to firebase
    


READ FROM FB: DISPLAY PIN
- head user reads PIN from firebase
- with a callback or a second clicked button



READ FROM FB: DRONES LOG IN
- drone enters pin, calls up the game object
- if pin matches:
    - drone reads questions & time limit
- function reads stop time and sets up a timer



WRITE TO FB: 
- timer ends
- drone sends an object to firebase
    - id = user id
    - correct
    - incorrect
    - total #
    - (ideally: clue correct answer & attempts)
        - e.g. 
        - clue = spell the word that means invertebrate with jointed legs
        - correct answer = arthropod
        - attempts = [anthropod, artopod, arthopod, arthoped]
- drone sends start and end time to firebase

READ FROM FB:
- timer ends on home computer
- home computer reads scores
- displays scores
- (ideally: shows green and red results)


CLEAN UP: 
    - in firebase, removing game and copying it into "finished" with a random header
    - (at some point in the future, this firebase game results
        should be written to sql)
