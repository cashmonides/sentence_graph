question: do we want to have subjunctives in english?
presumably no: get_tense_mood_sequence in english should contain only tense
If a language (like english) has no 'real' mood, get_time_mood_sequence
should probably just be time.




indirect statement - sequence matters


.......scio ....leonem canem amavisse
.......sciebam

prior english:   loved
