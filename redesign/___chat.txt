INTEGRATION
- probably our top priority right now
- I think the first step is to make a new latin mode

FIX IN DROP DOWN (fundamental issue)



FIX IN DROP DOWN (cosmetic issues)
- display sentences at the top
- lingering highlighting (not in jquery website)
- menu never closes (in jquery website)


ADD FUNCTIONALITY
- build in as an argument language of display 
    - (to start with we might just set it as randomized)
- turn off computation for all non-relevant languages
- display a single target sentence
    - for now all three languages
- add a function to the final click (e.g. select option as answer)
- make "header string" part of the drop downs
- make a function that promotes clicked answer to header string
- before check answer: 
    - e.g. starting position SUBJECT VERB OBJECT
    - hover on verb -> drop downs
    - select loved
    - "loved" replaces the string "verb" in the drop down
    - "loved" still hoverable and changeable
    - display answer gradually 
    - answer should replace the drop down (visually)
    - but the person should still be able to change their answer
        - hovering over the answer should open drop down
    - submit button sends the full answer to check answer
    - check answer highlight in red the part that's wrong

DESIRED BEHAVIOR
- header string should be "verb" or "subject"
- click on "header string" gives no action
- click on a final point changes header string
- sum of paths is your answer
- submit button submits your answer


AGENDA
- create drop down object with role as a property of the drop down
- make role the header string of drop down
- display drop down




OVERALL
- splits into two
    - restructuring the drop down data
        - has header strings
    - writing the functions

FUNCTIONS
- replace header string
- show drop down
- store drop down path as a variable

THINGS TO DO
- restructure the drop down data such that it has header strings like verb or subject
- add a submit button


DROP DOWN OBJECT
- header string
- drop down

target: the wolf loved the bear
goal: drops on all

initial appearance:
subject verb object

after a click:
wolf verb object



instead of
I love
because
you walk

we want
I love because you walk

SUBJECT VERB OBJECT (string: 'SUBJECT', drop down: <html element>)

(hover on subject)

wolf verb object    (string: null, drop down: <html element>)
bear
...
(the wolf selected)

the wolf verb object  (string: 'the wolf', drop down: <html element>)
