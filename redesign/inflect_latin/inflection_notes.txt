* put in extensive comments throughout code
* do english conjugation
* put in correct principle parts (currently we are using dummies)
* find why some conjugations do not work
* put in future subjunctives
* figure out tense from time without just a one-to-one correspondence
(we might need to also use the conjunction for this and perhaps even do it upstream)
* put in subject pronouns (we should be able to create them and put them before the verb,
but this will be trickier in the future due to scrambling)
* put in non-dummy agreement markers (this will be hard right now since
we don't have subject gender)
* make a lexeme constructor (not necessarily needed, but probably good for OO reasons)
