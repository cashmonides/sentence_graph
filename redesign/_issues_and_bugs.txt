- sequence should be determined independently for coordinating conjunctions
(maybe more generally?)
- he come
var come_lexeme = new Lexeme(testing_lexemes.come);
inflect_english_verb(come_lexeme, 'present active', '3s');
"he come"

- independent subjunctive is not currently constraining the verb to be subjunctive
- semantics: we don't currently constrain against past,indicative WHEN future, indicative
- semantics: "They attacked the city because I will find the money"
- semantics: we're currently allowing "you were commanded that I laugh"

- K C K has two possibilities
    - normal
        k[indicative] C k [subjunctive]
    - weird
        k[subjunctive] C k[subjunctive]
        (i.e. main clause that's independent subjunctive)
    - we don't want weird scenario happening randomly
    - it has to be constrained by allowed
    - one option:
        produce the c-null
        so the weird case looks like:
            (K) C-null K C K

    
- another scenario
    k0 c1 k1 c2 k2
    k1 will be constrained by c1 but not by c2
    so we need to make sure that it actually gets constrained
    
    
- downstream english will end up having very little determination
    - we can't just pick randomly
    - it has to match what has been determined
    - we have to mutate our kernels 
      until they have reached maximum point of determinsistic mutation within the linguistic regime of latin
      then we mutate randomly within the latin regime
    - then we consult the conjunction library (and any other exceptions library)
        - if it overrides, then we override
        - if it says null, we translate the latin
    - this seems to work for (mood, and tense)


- our current structure has only one kind of past and so can only restrict 
left and right kernels to past subjunctive, which in general is fine
since in general we only have a pst subjunctive, 
and sequence will tell us whether we're going to use primary or secondary options
but it's not very friendly to present and past ctf conditionals
should we just have some sort of overrride that forces the proper tense and mood?
(a similar override issue comes up for fmve conditionals. 
we just want to  override in latin with no change in other languages)
(or should we just have anoither time category future perfect?)



- for purposes of not repeating code, we've got to realize that many conjunctions overlap
    - there are some totally synonymous conjunctions (quod, quia, quando)
    we don't want to have a separate category for all of them
    so maybe when we specify their latin_form we can just give a list of synonymous options
    
    - a slightly more complicated case: cur, quando, ubi, quo modo (are all used in indirect questions, 
    but we might not want to create a separate category for them, 
    since they all have the same behavior)
    so we might want to create a category called c_interrogative
    and this would somehow contain them all
