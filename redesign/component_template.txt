below are just some rough notes, different ways for the data to look, though not necessarily generated this way

version A

component_template_1 : {
    kernel_form: [k_1, c_1, k_2],
    role_form: [[s, v], [c_when, s, v, o]],                 //the c can be at the head of the k_2 list as is, or it could be [k_1], [c], [k_2]
    kernel_map: {
        k_1: {
            subject: [animate || inanimate]
            verb: [intransitive || transitive && passive]                           
            object: null
        },
        c_1: {
            type: when
        },
        k_2: {
            subject: [animate]
            verb: [transitive]
            object: free_choice
