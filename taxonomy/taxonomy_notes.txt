QUESTION TYPES
- "CLASSIFY" given an animal and a distinction between 2,3,4,n categories - pick the category
    - wolf - is it quadruped, biped or arthropod?
- "PICK" given a classification of length n, pick the animal that matches
    - "pick the carnivorous biped"
- "ANALYZE WORD" (stealing from etymology) given a taxonomic term, classify it etymologically
    - carnivorous is composed of which roots? [plant, all, eat, four]
    - which of the following words contains the root meaning "large" [arthropod, macropod, biped, quadruped][
    - (this is just the usual etymology exercise, but limited to taxonomical words and roots)

IMPORTANT ISSUES
- the questions are level sensitive in a few ways:
    - what categories they know
        - ped, vor at early levels
        - ped, vor, gastr, therm at higher levels
    - how many distinctions in that category they know
        - at early levels: ped: [biped, quadruped]
        - at later levels: ped: [biped, quadruped, arthropod, macropod]
    - degree of sophistication:
        - at early levels: a bird is a biped
        - at later levels a bird is "bipedal, originally quadrupedal"
        - (likewise at early levels a whale is "not applicable" for ped but at later levels it is "vestigially quadrupedal")
    



PROCESS OF GENERATING QUESTIONS

0) get taxonomy_level from module


1) - generate a taxonomy_map (level-sensitive with taxonomy_level as argument)
- e.g. at a low level:
    {
    PED: ["biped", "quadruped"],
    VOR: ["herbivore", "carnivore", "omnivore"]
    }
    
  at a higher level:
    {
    PED: ["biped", "quadruped", "arthropod", "macropod"],
    VOR: ["herbivore", "carnivore", "omnivore", "insectivore", "detrivore"]
    }
    
    
2) generate a list of available animals from animal_level
- e.g. at a low level they have wolf, bear, crow, etc.
- at a higher level they have platypus and whale and cerebus

3) pick an animal from that list at random

4) pick a key of the taxonomy_map at random

- generate a JSON object:
    question_text: "Classify this animal."     //we can probably skip the text of the question - it will be clear enough if there's just a picture and a list of options or drop downs
    animal: "wolf",
    image: "../resources/wolf01.jpg",        //a sillhouette image of the animal at the
    image_or_name: "image",
    choices: ["biped", "quadruped"],
    correct_answer: "quadruped"
    wrong_feedback:
    right_feedback:
    cheat_sheet_objects:
    available_dummy_animals:
    
    
5) pick a question type at random from allowed question types ["classify", "pick", "analyze_word"]



CHEAT SHEET FOR TAXONOMY
- two options:
    - OPTION 1 (harder): just the roots (OV = egg, PAR = give birth)   //if so we need to classify the roots of each term (i.e. we need to make sure every taxonomic term is in our etymology file and that taxonomy can access it)
    - OPTION 2 (easier): definition (OVIPAROUS = giving birth to eggs)



DOWN THE ROAD FUNCTIONALITY
- maybe at advanced levels, they should be able to select multiple things in a drop-down and submit
- it would be nice:
    - if a student entered three classifications: wolf is quadruped, carnivore, invertebrate 
    - the feedback shows which one is wrong (maybe the wrong one is red or crossed out with the right answer beneath it)
