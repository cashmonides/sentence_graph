caterpillar: 'The lab I work in developed a way to record the vibrations a caterpillar produces when feeding on a leaf. We have found that plants are able to respond to this vibration when it is played back to them. It not only primes their defenses, but they can distinguish this vibration from vibrations caused by wind blowing, insects walking on them, insect mating calls, etc and they will not prime their defenses to those vibrations.
tl;dr Plants don't have ears, but they can still "hear."

giraffe: 'Giraffes have to eat from trees that are upwind from the other trees they eat from, because they release pheromones to warn the other trees. Anything downwind goes into defense mode, and releases chemicals that make the giraffe not want to eat from that tree.
Funny that animals have to hunt their plants, and find unsuspecting trees to eat from.'
