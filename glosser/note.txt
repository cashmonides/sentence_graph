our method before asking Gio
    - build a gloss page in sentence graph
    - connect it to Nicky's python stuff
    - create a mini database
    - update website
    - try to query the mini database

questions to gio
    - tackling any bugs with the "build glosser as an admin page"
    - is this a good idea?
    - can we host it on mediatemple and is that a good idea?
    -

first step: run it as an admin page in our sentence_graph project?
    - i.e. just like tag2
    - what do we need to do differently
    



    
    
for down the road, what do we need to do to set it up on a different page?
    - can mediatemple host an entirely different page?
    - or does it have to be under the same umbrella (bestiary.info)
